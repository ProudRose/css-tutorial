    <p>
      One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
      over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
      grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
      were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
      were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all
      scientific knowledge and new discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of
      millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires
      without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”
